Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3   
Implemented using C++ and click modular router.
===============================================


# Instructions  
When replacing ipnetwork.click file, it's important to put it inside our scripts/IGMPv3/ folder and run it from there:
	cd click-2.0.1/
	./userlevel/click -p 10000 scripts/IGMPv3/ipnetwork.click


Using telnet it's possible to play around with Client's and Router's elements:
	telnet localhost 10000


We have provided a handful of read and write handlers for demonstration purposes:

CLIENTS
=======
* Joins (by default PORT 1234, INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1, FILTER EXCLUDE, empty SRC list)
	write client21/reporter.join_group
	write client21/reporter.join_group PORT 1234, INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1, FILTER INCLUDE, SRC 192.168.1.1, SRC 1.1.1.2
	write client21/reporter.join_group PORT 1234, INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1, FILTER EXCLUDE, SRC 192.168.1.1

* Leaves (by default PORT 1234, INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1)
	write client21/reporter.leave_group
	write client21/reporter.leave_group PORT 1234, INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1

* Infobase Element states (per interface [currently only interface 0] and per socket [i.e. client's IP address:port])
	read client21/igmp_client_states.sockets
	read client21/igmp_client_states.interfaces

* Infobase Element values used by Reporter
    read client21/igmp_client_states.rrv
    read client21/igmp_client_states.uri

    write client21/igmp_client_states.rrv 2
    write client21/igmp_client_states.uri 1


ROUTERS
=======
* General Query (sends out on all attached interfaces)
	write router/querier.general_query

* Group Specific Query
	write router/querier.group_query INTERFACE 0, GROUP 225.0.0.1

* Router records per interface and per multicast group
	read router/igmp_router_states.records

* Infobase Element values used by Querier
    read router/igmp_router_states.qrv
    read router/igmp_router_states.qic
    read router/igmp_router_states.qri
    read router/igmp_router_states.gmi
    read router/igmp_router_states.sqic
    read router/igmp_router_states.sqc
    read router/igmp_router_states.lmqi
    read router/igmp_router_states.lmqc
    read router/igmp_router_states.lmqt

    write router/igmp_router_states.qrv 2
    write router/igmp_router_states.qic 125
    write router/igmp_router_states.qri 100
    write router/igmp_router_states.lmqi 10
    write router/igmp_router_states.lmqc 2
